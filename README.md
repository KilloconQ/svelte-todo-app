# Todo-Pomodoro
Hi, my name is Fernando.

I am creating a Pomodoro with a Todo List so you can focus on your tasks and know how much time you spend working on them.

This application will have two versions: one as an MVP with all the general functions, and another with some additional features available through an affordable subscription, should you wish to support me in continuing these projects outside my everyday work.

Thank you very much, and I hope it will be of great help to you.
